# DSA Interview Prep (Python)

This repository contains my solutions and notes for common **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems, organized by day for revision.

## Structure
- `DSA Python/Day XX/` → daily practice sets (5 problems)
- Each solution includes: approach + time/space complexity + key pitfalls (where applicable)
