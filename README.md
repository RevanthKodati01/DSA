# DSA Interview Prep (Python)

This repository contains my solutions and notes for common **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems, organized by day for revision.

## Structure
- `DSA Python/Day XX/` → daily practice sets (5 problems)
- Each solution includes: approach + time/space complexity + key pitfalls (where applicable)

## Contents

### Day 01 — Arrays + HashMap
- [Two Sum](Day%2001/LC1_TwoSum.py)
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](Day%2001/LC121_BuySellStock.py)
- [Contains Duplicate](Day%2001/LC217_ContainsDuplicate.py)
- [Product of Array Except Self](Day%2001/LC238_ProductExceptSelf.py)
- [Maximum Subarray](Day%2001/LC53_MaxSubarray.py)

### Day 02 — Two Pointers
- [Valid Palindrome](Day%2002/LC125_ValidPalindrome.py)
- [Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted](Day%2002/LC167_TwoSumII.py)
- [3Sum](Day%2002/LC15_3Sum.py)
- [Container With Most Water](Day%2002/LC11_ContainerWithMostWater.py)
- [Trapping Rain Water](Day%2002/LC42_TrappingRainWater.py)

### Day 03 — Sliding Window
- [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](Day%2003/LC121_BuySellStock.py)
- [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](Day%2003/LC3_LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.py)
- [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](Day%2003/LC424_LongestRepeatingCharacterReplacement.py)
- [Permutation in String](Day%2003/LC567_PermutationInString.py)
- [Minimum Window Substring](Day%2003/LC76_MinimumWindowSubstring.py)
